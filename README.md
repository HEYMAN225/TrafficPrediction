# Object Detection & Time Series Prediction Using YOLOv8 and LSTM

This project utilizes YOLOv8 for real-time object detection and tracking, combined with an LSTM model for time-series prediction based on collected data.

## üîç Overview
Using the pretrained YOLOv8 model `yolov8n.pt`, the system detects and tracks objects. The SORT algorithm by Alex Bewley ([alex@bewley.ai](mailto:alex@bewley.ai)) is used for tracking. The collected data is processed and analyzed using an LSTM model with `TimeseriesGenerator` to make future predictions.

## ‚ö° Features
- Real-time object detection using YOLOv8
- Object tracking with SORT algorithm
- Time-series prediction with LSTM
- Pre-trained dataset sourced from Kaggle

## üí° Usage
```bash
python YoloDetector.py   # Run YOLOv8 for object detection
python sort.py           # Perform object tracking
python LSTMPrediction.ipynb     # Train and evaluate LSTM model
```
